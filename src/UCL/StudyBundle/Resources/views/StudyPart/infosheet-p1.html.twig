<p>{{ 'Thank you for your interest in our research project. It is up to you to decide if you would like to proceed. This document will explain what the research is about so you can make an informed decision whether you want to proceed. This project contains 2 parts. You are now invited to participate in part 1. You can choose later whether to participate in part 2.' | trans }}</p>

<h3>{{ 'Details of Study' | trans }}</h3>
<p>{{ 'I study the ways in which people multitask with their computer. Specifically, how you perform multiple tasks concurrently, and how often your tasks are interrupted and resumed. I will collect data (see list below) on your personal computer about the applications you use, for a period of about 3 weeks. This will allow me to understand how often, how much and how you multitask. I will use the data to test if machine learning algorithms are able to reconstruct your multitasking patterns as well as a human.' | trans }}</p>

<p>{{ 'After the data collection, I will invite you for a 1-hour interview about how you use your computer. The interview will be done at UCL, or via Skype or Google Hangout based on your preferences. I will record and transcribe the interview, as a standard research practice to avoid missing or misinterpreting your answers. The audio recording files will be transferred from the recording devices to a UCL server which is only accessible to me, and erased from the original recording devices right after the interview. The recording files will be erased from the server after the transcription has taken place, and the transcripts will also be kept on that server.' | trans }}</p>

<p>{{ 'If you decide to participate to part 2 later on, you will be proposed to use an application to help you avoid interruptions and issues when multitasking, based on the results of the data collection. You will be able to propose changes to the software and you will decide how you want to use it and it can be made more useful for you.' | trans }}</p>

<h3>{{ 'To be eligible, you must:' | trans }}</h3>
<ul>
<li>{{ 'be an independent adult at least 18 years old' | trans }}</li>
<li>{{ 'Speak English fluently and be a EU resident' | trans }}</li>
<li>{{ 'actively use the computer used for the study for 3 weeks, at least 5 hours per week (you will be paid for each day when the collection software was active)' | trans }}</li>
<li>{{ 'use Ubuntu (14.04 or 15.04) as a Linux distribution' | trans }}</li>
<li>{{ 'use Unity and Google Chrome/Chromium Browser' | trans }}</li>
</ul>

<h3>{{ 'What data do I collect?' | trans }}</h3>
<p>{{ 'I will install a piece of software on your computer, based on <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">GNOME Zeitgeist</a> (a data collection framework used by Ubuntu), that will record which applications you use and the filenames of documents you open and save (the content is not recorded). I will record which windows are open at the same time, in which workspaces and how you switch between them. I will also record the titles of open windows and visited web pages (but not their content). I will record the title and message of error and warning dialogs to identify the causes of task interruptions. Metadata will be collected about your clipboard (but not the clipboard content). Finally, I will record when your computer is active and inactive (to calculate your reward). I do not record the content of your documents, your private conversations or emails, or what you type on your keyboard.' | trans | raw }}</p>

<h3>{{ 'What happens to your collected data?' | trans }}</h3>

Only I and a handful of colleagues have the necessary credentials to access this server and read your data. The data will be deleted as soon as the research project is over and its results have been published. It will be kept until June 2017 at the latest. If you decide that you want to withdraw from the study earlier than this data, you can contact me to have me delete your data.' | trans }}</p>
