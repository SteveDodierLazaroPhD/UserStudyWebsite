<p>Thank you for your interest in our research project. It is up to you to decide if you would like to proceed. This document will explain what the research is about so you can make an informed decision whether you want to proceed. This project contains 2 parts. You are now invited to participate in part 1. You can choose later whether to participate in part 2.</p>

<h3>Details of Study</h3>
<p>I study the ways in which people multitask with their computer. Specifically, how you perform multiple tasks concurrently, and how often your tasks are interrupted and resumed. I will collect data (see list below) on your personal computer about the applications you use, for a period of about 3 weeks. This will allow me to understand how often, how much and how you multitask. I will use the data to test if machine learning algorithms are able to reconstruct your multitasking patterns as well as a human.</p>

<p>After the data collection, I will invite you for a 1-hour interview about how you use your computer. The interview will be done at UCL, or via Skype or Google Hangout based on your preferences. I will record and transcribe the interview, as a standard research practice to avoid missing or misinterpreting your answers. The audio recording files will be transferred from the recording devices to a UCL server which is only accessible to me, and erased from the original recording devices right after the interview. The recording files will be erased from the server after the transcription has taken place, and the transcripts will also be kept on that server.</p>

<p>If you decide to participate to part 2 later on, you will be proposed to use an application to help you avoid interruptions and issues when multitasking, based on the results of the data collection. You will be able to propose changes to the software and you will decide how you want to use it and it can be made more useful for you.</p>

<h3>To be eligible, you must:</h3>
<ul>
<li>be an independent adult at least 18 years old</li>
<li>Speak English fluently and be a EU resident</li>
<li>actively use the computer used for the study for 3 weeks, at least 5 hours per week (you will be paid for each day when the collection software was active)</li>
<li>use Ubuntu (12.04 LTS, 14.10 or 15.04) or Debian (stable version) as a Linux distribution</li>
<li>use Xfce 4, Unity or GNOME 3 installed (version matching your distribution)</li>
<li>use either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as a Web browser</li>
</ul>

<h3>What data do I collect?</h3>
<p>I will install a piece of software on your computer, based on <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">GNOME Zeitgeist</a> (a data collection framework used by Ubuntu), that will record which applications you use and the filenames of documents you open and save (the content is not recorded). I will record which windows are open at the same time, in which workspaces and how you switch between them. I will also record the titles of open windows and visited web pages (but not their content). I will record the title and message of error and warning dialogs to identify the causes of task interruptions. Metadata will be collected about your clipboard (but not the clipboard content). Finally, I will record when your computer is active and inactive (to calculate your reward). I do not record the content of your documents, your private conversations or emails, or what you type on your keyboard.</p>

<h3>How to control what gets collected?</h3>
<p>The data is collected locally on your computer, and you are provided with an application (the <span class="fa fa-gear fa-fw"></span><a href="todo{#{ url('ucl_study_apps_study_manager') }#}">UCL Study Journal</a>) to view and delete events at any time prior to sending it over to UCL. You can also use the <span class="fa fa-gear fa-fw"></span><a href="todo{#{ url('ucl_study_apps_study_manager') }#}">UCL Study Privacy Settings</a> to temporarily or permanently suspend the collection of data related to a file or app you don't want us to know about. You can also delete previously collected data.</p>

<p>If you share your computer with other people, the data collection software will impact the performance of the system when they use it, because it collects data. The data is collected separately for each user, so you will not be able to send and I will not be able to obtain other users' data. You can prevent the performance impact for other users by making them turn off data collection using the <span class="fa fa-gear fa-fw"></span><a href="todo{#{ url('ucl_study_apps_study_manager') }#}">UCL Study Privacy Settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can send the collected data to UCL by using the <span class="fa fa-gear fa-fw"></span><a href="todo{#{ url('ucl_study_apps_study_manager') }#}">UCL Study Manager App</a>. It will tell you how many days you have completed and how many more days before you can send the data. The connection is encrypted.</p>

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">Your data will only be consulted by the researchers involved with this project, and by people mandated by UCL for PhD examination purposes. I may invite future collaborators from other academic institutions to help me with the analysis, but your data will never be shared with businesses or with non-academic institutions.</p>

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">If the data I collect contains evidence of illegal activities, I will not report such activities except for two cases. Under the UK Terrorism Act 2000, I have a duty to report on the preparation or performance of terrorist activities. I will report evidence of ongoing activities or plans to commit activities that put people in immediate danger (such as ongoing domestic abuse, or plans to rape or assault someone). In situations where nobody is in danger any longer, I will not report on any illegal activity.</p>

Under the UK Terrorism Act 2000, I have a duty to report on the preparation or performance of terrorist activities. As a French citizen, I also have a duty to assist people in immediate danger, which means I must report evidence of ongoing activities or plans to commit activities that put people in danger (such as domestic abuse, rape or assault). In situations where nobody is in danger any longer, I will not report any illegal activity.</p>

<h3>What happens to your collected data?</h3>
<p>The data is stored at all times on a private server in a location accessible only from within the UCL network. The data collected on your computer is sent via an encrypted connection to that server (via our participant website), and the data collected during interviews is manually transferred to the server right after the interview (and all recording equipment wiped). Only I and a handful of colleagues have the necessary credentials to access this server and read your data. The data will be deleted as soon as the research project is over and its results have been published. It will be kept until June 2017 at the latest. If you decide that you want to withdraw from the study earlier than this data, you can contact me to have me delete your data.</p>

<p>Benefits of the study for you: completing part 1 will make you eligible for part 2, in which you will be able to test a new application designed to help you multitask. You will be able to keep using the application after part 2. I will also answer any question you have after you have completed the study or withdrawn.</p>

<h3>Remuneration</h3>
<p>you will be paid for each part you decide to participate to, as follows. Payments can be made in cash (to collect in London), Amazon vouchers and (provisional) Paypal transfers.</p>

<h4>Part 1:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>£1.5 per day of data collected (at least £5 and up to £30)</li>
  <li>£20 for coming to the mid-project interview</li>
</ul>
<h4>Part 2:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>£1.5 per day during tool use (up to £40)</li>
  <li>£10 for coming to the debriefing interview</li>
</ul>

<h3>Opting out</h3>
<p> If you don't want to proceed to part 2, or if you change your mind and want to quit at any point during part 1, it will not affect how you are treated as a participant and will not affect the promised reward for your participation so far (I will pay you for each day of data that you decide to send me – if you decide to send no data I will pay you a minimum compensation of £5). If you change your mind and would like me to remove some of your collected data, or to withdraw entirely from the study, you can do so at any time by using the <a href="{{ url('ucl_study_contact') }}">contact form</a> or sending me an email at <a href="mailto:s.dodier-lazaro@ucl.ac.uk">s.dodier-lazaro@ucl.ac.uk</a>. You do not have to provide any justification, although it would be helpful to improve future studies and appreciated.</p>

<p class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">Please note that I cannot delete results that were published in academic venues and based on your data, however these results will never contain personally identifiable information.</p>
