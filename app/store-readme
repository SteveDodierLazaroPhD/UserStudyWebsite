You must create a directory called app/store to get started.
This folder (and children folders) must be created so that apache cannot read it. It must be write-only.
This is critically important: it will prevent exploited apaches from being used to steal participant data.
Remember that we do not encrypt the data in the store for convenience, hence we rely on good practice with
Linux access control for the security to hold. DO NOT DEPLOY A WEBSITE WITH A READABLE STORE!

If you use a screening phase, you must also create app/store/screening.
If you use an upload phase, you must also create app/store/upload.

These names are subject to changing. Grep "store" on the UCL StudyBundle for updated or custom names, and create folders accordingly.
