Permission setup:
-464/575 for almost everything with apache:webdev owner (allows staff and interns in webdev to code)
-664/775 for app/cache and app/logs (must be writable by apache)
-300 for app//store (must be writable but not readable -- for study data uploads)

Things to do:
- create the appropriate user in the MySQL db, with a password of your choice
- create app/config/parameters.yml and add your MySQL user/password information
- make sure app/store/ is configured as desired
- [tweak app/config/ further if necessary, normally it is not]
- go to src/UCL/StudyBundle/Resources/config/ and hack your project into shape!
