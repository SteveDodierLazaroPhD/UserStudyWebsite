Permission setup:
-464/575 for almost everything with apache:somedevgroup owner (allows staff and interns in somedevgroup to code)
-664/775 for app/cache and app/logs (must be writable by apache)
-370 or 300 for app/store (must be writable but not readable -- for study data uploads)



Things to do:
- create the database in the MySQL db (requires connecting to the db as root)
  CREATE DATABASE `yourprojectname`;
- create the appropriate user in the MySQL db, with a password of your choice
  CREATE USER 'yourprojectname'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourGENERATEDandLONGpassword';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `yourprojectname`.* TO 'yourprojectname'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
- give the password to the authorised users by leaving it in a file in their home
- generate the DB tables with Doctrine
  $ php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
- create app/config/parameters.yml and add your MySQL user/password information
  $ cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml
  $ nano app/configs.parameters.yml
- make sure app/store/ is configured as desired (at least writable upload/, upload/archive and screening/ folders)
- [tweak app/config/ further if necessary, normally you don't need to]
- go to src/UCL/StudyBundle/Resources/config/ and hack your project into shape!
